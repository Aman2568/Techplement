# Techplement
This Repository contains an example of monolithic and microservices architecture. 
In Monolithic Architecture, we have a single EC2 instance which has MySQL and WordPress deployed in it.
In Microservices Architecture, we have 2 EC2 instances in which 1 instance has MySQL and the other has Wordpress deployed separately in them.
